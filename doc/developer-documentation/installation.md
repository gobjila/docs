# Installation

Make sure you have basic knowledge of PHP5, Apache or Nginx and MySQL to install BackBee.

## Third-party software

You need to check that your computer has an appropriate working environment for web development. You need at least a web server (Apache, for instance), a database engine (MySQL, MariaDB), and **PHP 5.4**.

You need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the dependency manager for PHP.

If your are on Linux/Unix based (like ubuntu or Mac OS X), follow this [link](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) for installation. Composer is also available on [Windows system](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows).

In a command line interface, check if `composer` is correctly installed:

Also, check your PHP version which should be 5.4 or more.

Set up a domain name in your operating system.
On Unix/Linux based OS, you can add it into `/etc/hosts` file. In our case, we want to add **blogbee.dev**:

    127.0.0.1   blogbee.dev

You are ready to start the installation process.

## Web Installer

Open a command line interface and get BackBee Standard Edition:

    $ composer create-project "backbee/backbee-standard" /path/to/your/folder "~1.1" --no-interaction

From the `public` directory, launch the builtin server of PHP:

    $ cd /path/to/your/folder/public && php -S blogbee.dev:8000

### Step 1 - Requirements checks

To see the first installation step of BackBee, go to [http://blogbee.dev:8000/install.php](http://blogbee.dev:8000/install.php) with your favorite web browser:

The `cache/`, `log/`, `repository/Data/`, `public/` and `repository/Config` folders must be owned by the apache or nginx user. If this user is unknown then set the rights to `0777`. Refresh and modify your environment until everything is green so you can go to the **second step**.

### Step 2 - General application configuration

If required, set folder rights to be `0777` for `repository/Config` and then go to the **third** step.

### Step 3 - Database and super admin configurations

BackBee Installer automatically creates and populates the database. The only thing you have to do is to set your database settings. Note that we highly recommend to use MySQL or MariaDB.

You also want to define your super admin user, fill the credentials then save and go forward to the **fourth** step.

### Step 4 - Site configuration

As last step, you have to choose your **site name** and fill its URL.

At the end of this step, BackBee will create an empty file named `INSTALL_OK` in the `public/` folder. As long as this file exists the installation cannot start. So if for any reason you want to re-run the installation process, you have to remove this file first.

### Apache2 and Nginx virtualhosts configurations

Installation is now completed. BackBee generates and provides the `Apache2` or `Nginx` virtualhost configuration. To get the best experience of BackBee CMS, we recommend you to setup the one that match your environment.

When your web server is set up, you can start using BackBee with the URL **[http://blogbee.dev](http://blogbee.dev)**.

If everything is correctly installed, you should see the BackBee welcome message:

> *If you can't see BackBee welcome message, make sure that `cache` and `log` folders have the correct rights. (755 or 777)*

You can switch into edition mode by pressing simultaneously `CTRL + ALT + B`. The expected credentials are these you setted up at step 4.

## Category and article fixtures

If you want to load some fixtures, you can run this command from your project root directory:

    $ ./backbee fake:data:generate --article-limit 20 --category-limit 5

You can choose the number of articles and categories to generate by respectively changing `20` and `5`.

## Ubuntu and PHP's sessions

If your operating system is Ubuntu, you might meet the following error while PHP is trying to write its sessions:

```
SessionHandler::read(): open(/var/lib/php5/sessions/sess_ne8pqe6qshr0hc6sn9nrmhpfc5, O_RDWR) failed: Permission denied (13) in /var/www/html/bb/vendor/symfony/http-foundation/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Session/Storage/Proxy/SessionHandlerProxy.php on line 69
```

This is due to the user which executes PHP. He has not the right to write in the session's storage folder. You can solve this by using the command `chmod` or changing the session storage folder.

You can also take a look at [puphpet/puphpet#1195](https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues/1195) to learn more about this issue.
